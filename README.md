# MN-Labor-Market-Analysis-2024
This project analyzes Minnesota’s 2024 labor market to understand how wages, job vacancies, unemployment, and cost of living align across regions and industries. The goal was to identify where labor shortages persist, where wages fall short of financial stability benchmarks, and what policy or employer actions could address those gaps.
