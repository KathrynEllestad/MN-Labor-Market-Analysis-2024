# Minnesota Labor Market Analysis (2024)

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Minnesota’s labor market in 2024 to evaluate how wages, job vacancies, unemployment, and workforce turnover vary across regions and industries. The analysis focuses on whether current labor market conditions support financial stability for workers and where mismatches between labor supply, demand, and cost of living are most pronounced.

The goal of the project is to support workforce planners, regional development boards, policymakers, and employers by identifying where targeted wage adjustments, training investments, and retention strategies may have the greatest impact.

## Key Questions

This analysis was guided by the following questions:

- Do wages across Minnesota regions meet basic cost-of-living benchmarks for single adults?
- Where does vacancy pressure exceed the available labor supply?
- Which regions experience the greatest seasonal unemployment volatility?
- Are workforce separations primarily driven by layoffs or voluntary quits?
- What structural factors help explain persistent labor shortages in key industries?

## Data Sources

This project combines multiple public datasets to provide a statewide and regional perspective:

- **Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED)**
  - Job Vacancy Survey
  - Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS)
  - Unemployment Insurance (UI) claims data
  - Cost of Living estimates for single adults
- **U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)**
  - Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS)

### Data Limitations

- Analysis is limited to 2024 due to incomplete prior-year coverage.
- Some datasets, such as JOLTS, lack detailed regional or industry breakdowns.
- Monthly data were not seasonally adjusted and required alignment across regions and sources.

## Metrics & Methods

The analysis centers on several key indicators designed to highlight labor market balance and stress:

- **Wage Sufficiency**  
  Regional average wages were evaluated against a 1.7 benchmark, representing the income level required for a single adult to follow a 50/30/20 budget model for necessities, discretionary spending, and savings.

- **Vacancy Pressure**  
  Measured by comparing job vacancies to available labor supply, using unemployment and UI claimant data to assess where demand most strongly exceeds supply.

- **Unemployment Claim Intensity**  
  Examined over time to identify seasonal patterns and regional volatility, particularly in weather-sensitive industries.

- **Turnover and Attrition**  
  Workforce separations were analyzed to distinguish between voluntary quits and employer-driven layoffs or discharges.

All metrics were evaluated at both the statewide and regional level to surface geographic differences.

## Key Findings

- No Minnesota region meets the 1.7 wage sufficiency benchmark for single adults.
- Healthcare, education, and service occupations show the highest and most persistent vacancy pressure.
- Northeast and Southeast Minnesota experience predictable seasonal unemployment spikes, particularly in tourism, construction, and education-related roles.
- The majority of workforce separations are voluntary quits rather than layoffs, indicating retention challenges rather than widespread job scarcity.
- Higher wages in metro areas are often offset by higher housing and transportation costs, limiting real financial stability.

## Recommendations

Based on the findings, several actions could help reduce labor market strain:

- Align wages more closely with regional cost-of-living conditions rather than statewide averages.
- Expand transferable training programs and apprenticeships in high-demand industries.
- Stabilize seasonal employment through off-season projects, cross-training, and infrastructure work.
- Improve retention by offering clearer career pathways, flexibility, and support for employee well-being.
